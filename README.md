## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have gained a better understanding of flexbox. One piece of CSS that blew my mind was that you can set the margin-top of an element to auto and it shifts it down (or right depending on the flex direction). This was very helpful for the learn more button that's included in this code. I also found that setting the html/body to min-height: 100vh(or 100%) vs just height helps with the code not chopping at the top when the height shrinks.

### Continued development

I will now be using the min-height property for the html/body going forward. I will also continue to use and develope my knowledge in flexbox. I believe I will continue with this and also get more practice using Grid. 

### Useful resources
